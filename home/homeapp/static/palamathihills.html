    <h2 style="font-family: serif;"> Palamathi hills also known as the 'Balamathi hills', this is a site which covers a portion of the 
        Eastern Ghats as it runs through Vellore. This is one of the most popular places to visit in Vellore because of the Otteri lake 
        and Palamathi forest reserve. Here the atomosphere is very nice. Above the hills there is a old temple.
